        <h1>GAME PROTOTYPES:</h1>
        <p>
          These are game prototypes I’ve worked on using the UNITY game engine
          during my time studying at WITS university.<br />
          During my free time I like to make changes and improve on prototypes
          that I received good results on.

        <p>
          For this visual novel I was focused on the narrative part of the game.
          The prompt given was ‘support’. Using this prompt, I explored the idea
          of the struggle of building courage to ask for help when you are going
          through a rough time. In the visual novel you play as a character who
          has just endured a season ending injury and now has to take on the
          challenge of asking for support/help(which is something athletes don’t
          often do due to having a winning and independent mindset they tend to
          have- I’ve referenced my own journey as an athlete myself) during her
          road to full recovery. I try to show this through the choices I
          present the player with.

          This 2D platformer was a task I’ve enjoyed as I haven’t played many 2D
          platformer games before conquering this task. In this prototype I
          explore level design and what makes a level good. I analysed levels of
          games I’ve played and considered what made the level enjoyable. I
          incorporated level changes and made use of increasing difficulty after
          the player made it past a certain checkpoint in the level. The goal of
          game was to save the cherry king from the evil cupcake vigilante.
