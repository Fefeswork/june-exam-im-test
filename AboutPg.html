        My name is Ofentse “Fefe” Magabeane. <br />I was born and raised in
        South Africa in the city of Johannesburg. I am still based in
        Johannesburg as I am completing my tertiary studies. <br />I am a
        third-year student studying a BA Digital Arts degree majoring in
        Interactive Media and Writing and Interactivity at the University of
        Witwatersrand.<br />
        I am also an athlete at WITS university, I participate in basketball,
        and I am captain of the WITS ladies’ 2nd team. <br />I work well in
        teams as well as individually. <br />I love working with UX/UI, writing
        stories, and engaging with anything that deals with digital game. I hope
        to learn more as I navigate this career path and network with more
        people in the industry.
