          <h2>Blog 1: The medium is the message</h2>
          <h3>Author of Book: McLuhan, M.</h3>
          <p>
            McLuhan in a way foreshadowed the evolution of media in a way,
            considering there was little to no technology during his time and
            content was spread through writing and not so much technology. It
            makes me wonder if people did know that technology would advance
            over time. After investigating to comparison McLuhan makes between a
            lightbulb and medium, I then started thinking about being stranded
            on an island. As seen on tv the sand on the beach seems useless
            unless you start writing some content that is your message which is
            then read and understood by some who will eventually rescue you. One
            line did stand out to me while reading this: “For the “message” of
            any medium or technology is the change of scale or pace or pattern
            that it introduces into human affairs.” This line, in particular,
            stood out to me because I immediately thought of what a big
            influence social media has on society today. A lot of messages are
            shared through social media, an example is learning a new skincare
            tip from a social media influencer or learning a cheat code for a
            level you couldn’t beat in a game from a streamer. Social media has
            also been the instigator for bad messages, these bad messages being
            display fake standard beauty standards which lead to people being
            self-conscious about themselves.

          <h2>Blog 2: Semantic Markup- what is it and why is it necessary</h2>
          <h3>Author of Article:Lawson, B.</h3>
          <p>
            What is Sematic markup? Semantic markup refers to how you structure
            and write your code with regards to HTML, we can also look at is as
            the layout of the website. It also entails as to why certain
            structures and formats work better than others in terms of writing
            quality code. How I understand this is simple thinking of it as
            layers within layers: an example I will use is a sports team, in
            sports teams we have different ranks that help the entire team
            function: we have the team managers which manage the team and ensure
            that everything is running smoothly. Underneath the managers we have
            the coaches: strength and conditioning coach, assistant coach, and
            the head coach. Although they all fall under the category of coach,
            they each have a specific part of the team they run which
            distributes the role evenly. Then finally we have the players which
            are being managed by the coaches and the managers. Without the
            coaches nand managers there would be no team and without the players
            there wouldn’t be a team to coach. This analogy links nicely with
            the concept of semantic markup, as we can think of it in that way.
            In the reading Lawson writes : “So a homepage with a list of blog
            posts would be a ‘main’ element wrapping a series of ‘article’
            elements, one for each blog post”(Lawson,2022). In this line he is
            describing how a ‘main’ consists of ‘articles’ with in the
            container. In my own work I had not really considered sematic markup
            until we looked into it and why it is a thing in web development.
            After learning about this and applying my sports team analogy it has
            helped me structure my code better to structure my website better
            Semantic markup is necessary because it helps developers write clear
            code, it provides a better site structure, it also plays a role in
            how your overall website performs as well as it improves the quality
            of accessibility to the developers’ site

          <h2>Blog 4: The importance of Accessibilty</h2>
          <h3>McLuhan, M.</h3>
          <p>
            What is accessibility? <br />Accessibility can be seen as how
            “accessible” a product is. In terms of design, it can refer to how
            usable is your product. When designing a product especially in the
            digital space. It is very import to take into account the
            accessibility aspect of you works. Accessibility focuses on
            equipping people with disabilities access to reliable and assertive
            technology so that they can also benefit from the advantages of
            using technology. Why is this important? As mentioned above it is to
            consider people with disabilities. We know that there are three
            types of accessibilities we as designers need to consider these
            being: motor, auditory and visual. In the digital space we try to
            consider all three, we also look for new methods to present digital
            work and new way to make it accessible. What I know about
            Accessibility: During my general studies outside of interactive
            media, I’ve learned how to incorporate accessibility in my work.
            I’ve most worked on accessibility for Visual disabilities such as
            red-green colour blindness and dyslexia. When designing colour
            palettes, I avoid using red, green and in some cases blues. I opt
            for softer and easy on the eye colours such as your greys, light
            pinks, whites, and blacks. I am also careful with the fonts I
            choose; I avoid flashy and fancy fonts as most of the time people
            cannot differentiate the letter make it hard to read what the
            developer is trying to communicate to the user. From doing research
            I now understand that the font that I use a lot ‘times new roman’
            isn’t necessarily accessible, I can see why because it does have a
            few letters which are hard to differentiate at times. I should look
            at more neutral fonts like Helvica and Lucia as those font are
            considered accessible.

          <h2>Blog 6: Refelction on UX/UI</h2>
          <h3>Written by: Magabeane, O.</h3>
          <p>
            Reflection on UI and UX What is user interface:<br />
            I think I’ve done a decent job with regards to my UI and UX, I give
            the user an easy and clear structure of how the website functions. I
            do however, think I could expand more on this and consider this more
            as I feel like I was rather designing the webpage for me and not
            necessarily the user. An example of this would be when I was
            designing the a wireframes and the aesthetic of the website: I did
            consider the user to a certain extent but landed up giving in to
            what looked and felt nice for me. the good: I think what I’ve been
            able to do well is consider the accessibility of the website as a
            wholesale I made sure to choose colour schemes that catered to
            people who may be colour blindness. With the fonts I managed to
            choose fonts that were easy to read to cater to people who may not
            be cognitive disabilities such as dyslexia. My wireframes an east to
            navigate and aren’t to be overwhelming to the user. The bad: The
            overall responsiveness of the design isn’t quite polished yet, only
            certain elements respond well to the change in size such as the
            headers and images, however, the text on each page does not adjust
            accordingly which messes with the design. I could’ve applied my
            theory work a little more in terms of my design and offering users a
            better experience. The aesthetic doesn’t necessarily match what the
            content of my website: I focused on making it pretty instead of
            making use of the aesthetic to convey the message.

          <h3>McLuhan, M.</h3>
          <p>
            Reflecting back on the work I have done this semester I have learned
            a lot as a web developer, and I still have a lot to learn. I have
            managed to grasp a lot of concepts with ease and other are still a
            bit hard to grasp but with practice I think I’ll become better in
            those aspects. Looking at my work. I think I’ve done a decent job in
            creating this website, I’ve managed to apply the theory I’ve learned
            throughout the semester: I believe I’ve improved in terms of writing
            quality code and making use of semantic markup to write clear code.
            I’ve also managed to take the critical feedback I’ve received by my
            peers and apply it the work. In terms of creativity, I think I’ve
            grown as a designer, I’ve learned not to design for aesthetics only
            but through my choice of design I should communicate a message too.
            With the first two assignments I did not take that into account and
            ended up designing according to what will good, but now I’ve been
            able to communicate what my website entails through the images and
            information I’ve chosen to display. In terms of accessibility- I
            think my website is fairly accessible. I made decisions based of
            feedback I’ve received from people with the disabilities( a few
            family members and friends) I was catering for. I reflect this in my
            style guide where I explain why I’ve made the design decisions I’ve
            made. I have also decided to work with very basic wireframe designs
            that are known by many people because a product is often well
            received when it is something new but with a sense of familiarity.
            Reflecting on my strengths and weaknesses this semester, I’ve
            realised that I haven’t been able to grasp JavaScript as much as I
            would have liked to. This is also seen in my work- there’s very
            minimal JavaScript being used due to my lack of confidence to
            incorporate it in my work. My strengths have been working with CSS
            as well as HTML- I feel like those are my strongest programming
            languages that I have used this semester. This is seen through the
            coding scripts I’ve written with some assistance from documentation.
            I use a lot of comments to show that I understand what each line of
            code is doing in the document. Overall, I believe that I still have
            a lot to learn as a web developer in terms of learning efficient
            ways to improve on my programming skills.
